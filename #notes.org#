#+TITLE: The Rust Programming Language

* The Basics
- Compiling and running the program are separate steps.
- Rustup : a CL tool for managing Rust versions and associated tools

** Cargo
Build system and package manager for Rust.
- cargo new : create new cargo project
- cargo init : create Cargo.toml for a pre-existing project
- cargo build : creates an executable in target/debug/<dirname>
  The default build is a debug build.
  Running cargo build for the first time also creates a Cargo.lock file at the top level.
  + Keeps track of the exact versions of dependencies in the project.
- cargo run : compile and run
- cargo check : checks code to make sure it compiles, but doesn't produce an executable.
- cargo build --release : compile project with optimizations, when it is ready for release
  + Executable is created in target/release instead of target/debug
  + Use for benchmarking.
